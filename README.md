Gabe Larkin; Mind like a scientist, arm like a howitzer, ****....oh wait that's Kenny Powers.

That's the only clever line from East Bound and Down...and I probably butchered it! /aside

Just getting familiar with Github. Most of my personal projects are either hosted locally or saved as some CodePen file I am messing around with. Today that changes. Today I start archiving my work on GitHub. 

With any luck I can find some cool open source project to contribute to while I am here.

Gabe, over and out.
